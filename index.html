          <h2>What is The Magnus Archives?</h2>
          <p>
            The Magnus Archives was a weekly horror fiction anthology podcast examining what lurks
            in the archives of the Magnus Institute, an organisation dedicated to researching the
            esoteric and the weird. Join new head archivist Jonathan Sims as he attempts to bring a
            seemingly neglected collection of supernatural statements up to date, converting them to
            audio and supplementing them with follow-up work from his small but dedicated team.
            Individually, they are unsettling. Together they begin to form a picture that is truly
            horrifying because as they look into the depths of the archives, something starts to
            look back…
